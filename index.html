    <p>'delhiz'...a doorway
    </p>

    <p>
    a births
    <br/>
    in essence
    <br/>
    a threshold to exist
    <br/>
    an i
    <br/>
    taking shape
    <br/>
    chipped by ayes and desist
    </p>

    <p>
    a life
    <br/>
    to experience
    <br/>
    in paths bound by more
    <br/>
    as ends
    <br/>
    in beginnings
    <br/>
    with death keeping score
    </p>

    <p>
    as steps
    <br/>
    to divine
    <br/>
    or to hell does it roll
    <br/>
    a state
    <br/>
    of ones self
    <br/>
    mind body...or soul
    </p>

    <p>
    an exit
    <br/>
    or a doorway
    <br/>
    whose to know who can tell
    <br/>
    are mysteries beyond
    <br/>
    writ in acts
    <br/>
    'lived' as well?
    </p>

    <p>
    a 'delhiz'
    <br/>
    marks out space
    <br/>
    within 'times'...of sensed frames
    <br/>
    a choice?
    <br/>
    opening 'doors'
    <br/>
    claiming substance...in names...
    <br/>
    as one ages...
    <br/>
    growing tired
    <br/>
    of playing...new games
    <br/>
    'thin' skin
    <br/>
    bruised by scars
    <br/>
    now too 'thick'...unashamed
    <br/>
    from still life
    <br/>
    grows peace
    <br/>
    birthed wildness...now tamed
